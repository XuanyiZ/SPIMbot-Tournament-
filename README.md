# SPIMbot-Tournament-
We use a destination queue to store all the destinations and move to each of them one by one. When we receive max growth interruption, we scan all the tiles and push all the plants ready for harvesting to the end of the queue. Alone the way moving to each destination, we will seed and set fire whenever possible.
